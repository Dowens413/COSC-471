Yousif Shkara:
Hello, my name is Yousif Shkara, a senior at EMU, majoring in Computer Science Curriculum. I have done many projects CS-related and not. Including, making servers, building computers, building applications and websites that are incorporated in my daily life, making things a lot easier and saving time. In my work experience, If there's anything in my life that can be improved via computer science or IT, then I would possibly pursue it, and I never turn down learning opportunities. Things I love doing on the side when I'm not working are hanging out with friends and gaming.
